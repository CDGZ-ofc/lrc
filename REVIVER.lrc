[00:01.230]Saved from eternal dreams
[00:07.420]Like the kings and queens in fables of old
[00:15.680]Stir now from an endless sleep
[00:22.150]Let the children weep for your embrace
[00:29.720]Return to me and break this heart of stone
[00:36.360]Show me that it's time to bring you home
[00:44.900]Turn the key to cast away the veil
[00:52.150]We're dying to see you
[00:55.870]So don't let me fail
[01:00.760]Still like a figurine
[01:07.100]You were so serene
[01:09.870]As leaves turned to gold
[01:14.870]So sail back to the distant shores
[01:22.230]For the world adores
[01:25.040]It pines for you
[01:29.690]Return to me and break this heart of stone
[01:36.480]Show me that it's time to bring you home
[01:44.940]Turn the key to cast away the veil
[01:52.200]We're dying to see you
[01:55.880]So don't let me fail
[02:03.790]Rejoice
[02:06.610]Finally the day will come
[02:11.220]to be back with an angel
[02:18.800]Rejoice
[02:21.610]Finally the day will come
[02:26.110]We can meet again
[02:30.000]We can meet again
[02:34.650]Hope that was almost gone
[02:40.810]Like a dwindled flame
[02:43.800]You're near once again
[02:48.690]True kindness long ago we lost
[02:56.050]Had to get it back and face the cost
