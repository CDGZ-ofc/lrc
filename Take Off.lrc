[00:27.827]Nothing matters if I fight for my dreams
[00:31.013]I'm never giving up on myself
[00:33.207]
[00:33.533]Every moment of my life
[00:36.011]I'll carry it on to my highway
[00:39.144]
[00:39.489]I'm not scared of being alone
[00:41.054]Already got this
[00:42.053]Heading in my own direction
[00:44.780]There's no time for me to look back
[00:47.631]Holding on to keep on rising to the sky
[00:52.685]
[00:53.407]I'll be taking actions
[00:55.224]No distractions
[00:56.607]I just wanna be who I wanna be
[00:58.826]
[00:59.105]I don't need exceptions
[01:00.878]No delusions
[01:02.296]Chance is only once, you know
[01:04.368]
[01:04.685]When I'm lost and start to fall, let me fly up more
[01:07.604]Go on, I've been waiting for this so long
[01:10.346]Fate is calling me, unlock another door
[01:14.251]And shine the hope inside my heart
[01:18.226]
[01:18.854]I don't need your sympathy
[01:21.249]Have it my way
[01:23.630]I don't care what people say
[01:25.695]As long as there's a path to make
[01:28.395]Moving forward till the end
[01:30.607]I'm not scared of being alone
[01:32.138]Already got this
[01:33.212]Heading in my own direction
[01:35.882]There's no time for me to look back
[01:38.704]Holding on to keep on rising to the sky
[01:44.143]
[01:44.481]Breaking chain reactions
[01:46.412]No illusions
[01:47.767]I wanna see what I wanna see
[01:49.982]
[01:50.227]I'll defeat my obsessions
[01:52.010]No hesitations
[01:53.432]Breathing dreams like air in this world
[01:55.533]
[01:55.856]When I start to feel I'm wrong, let me prove I'm not
[01:58.693]Run on, I've been seeking this for so long
[02:01.468]It's the stage for me, unlock another door
[02:05.367]And shine the hope inside my heart
[02:09.315]
[02:18.492]I can't deny
[02:19.633]Don't ask me why
[02:21.333]It's so simple, just survive
[02:23.850]I'll never cry out cause the future awaits me
[02:27.439]Remember that to keep in mind
[02:30.017]
[02:41.190]I'll be taking actions
[02:43.118]No distractions
[02:44.535]I just wanna be who I wanna be
