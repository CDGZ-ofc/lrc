[00:13.706]To be the pinnacle, there’s a price
[00:16.859]A model of virtue above the vice
[00:20.517]Dressed in gold and flowing white
[00:24.084]The dark is vanquished by your light
[00:29.353]Pretenders that would give their lives
[00:33.053]If painless and was televised
[00:35.599]It’s not easy being nice
[00:38.435]It’s not about the merchandise
[00:43.621]It's so serene, the blue and green, from outer space
[00:49.491]If we all could make it work, it could be such a happy place
[00:58.003]To broker peace so pain can cease
[01:01.360]We are much more than the sum of all our parts
[01:07.175]So go and capture all their hearts
[01:12.568]Cuz you are the teacher
[01:15.479]Shine like a sapphire to guide us
[01:18.910]Wisdom is just in your nature
[01:22.534]Fighting for justice
[01:24.218]You take us higher
[01:28.860]Saw the potential to be good
[01:32.238]So many just misunderstood
[01:35.864]So many lost deep in the wood shall find a way
[01:55.584]Can imagine a world with no fear of hate
[01:58.983]Waking up with no reason for feeling great
[02:02.605]Can imagine the world that you can create
[02:05.995]You’re the fate
[02:06.859]You’re the fate that we deserve
[02:11.612]Paragon, just cut through the night
[02:15.092]Guide us with your beacon of light
[02:18.808]Paragon, just cut through the night
[02:22.356]Guide us with your beacon of light
