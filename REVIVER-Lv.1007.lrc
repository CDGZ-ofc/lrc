[00:00.855]Saved from eternal dreams
[00:07.300]Like the kings and queens in fables of old
[00:15.912]Stir now from an endless sleep
[00:22.229]Let the children weep for your embrace
[00:29.371]
[00:29.552]Return to me and break this heart of stone
[00:36.523]Show me that it's time to bring you home
[00:45.104]Turn the key to cast away the veil
[00:52.378]We're dying to see you
[00:56.112]So don't let me fail
[01:00.351]
[01:00.773]Still like a figurine
[01:07.252]You were so serene
[01:10.032]As leaves turned to gold
[01:15.091]So sail back to the distant shores
[01:22.439]For the world adores
[01:25.185]It pines for you
[01:29.548]
[01:29.711]Return to me and break this heart of stone
[01:36.721]Show me that it's time to bring you home
[01:45.159]Turn the key to cast away the veil
[01:52.417]We're dying to see you
[01:56.127]So don't let me fail
[02:00.489]
[02:03.849]Rejoice
[02:06.680]Finally, the day will come
[02:11.416]to be back with an angel
[02:18.974]Rejoice
[02:21.785]Finally, the day will come
[02:26.313]We can meet again
[02:30.184]We can meet again
[02:34.161]
[02:34.781]Hope that was almost gone
[02:40.952]Like a dwindled flame
[02:43.754]You're near once again
[02:48.856]True kindness long ago we lost
[02:56.057]Had to get it back andface the cost
