[00:07.564]深く刺さる　胸を貫く
[00:10.265]痛み　目覚め　意識　スパーク
[00:12.644]Injected fire in my veins,
[00:15.137]Lost in pleasure, free from pains.
[00:17.405]
[00:17.517]オーバーヒート心臓が
[00:20.228]脈打つ速度は190
[00:22.746]When light and dark clash,
[00:25.092]in that spree fire's surge, sets my spirit free
[00:27.577]
[00:27.718]純真無垢？
[00:28.833]馬鹿にしないでよ
[00:30.311]私の何を知ってるの？
[00:32.350]寧ろ大胆不敵
[00:33.945]いつも隠してる
[00:35.345]退屈な速度じゃ感じない
[00:37.596]
[00:37.860]Give me a reason to beat you down,
[00:40.295]I'll take the crown, won't wear no frown.
[00:42.945]You're in my way, time to face the truth,
[00:45.364]I'll reign supreme, that's my proof.
[00:47.996]
[00:53.044]止まらない神経
[00:54.158]隠せない神性
[00:55.483]きまりやばすぎて　気がつけば禁制
[00:58.153]すかすかの脳に
[00:59.418]プラス半殺し
[01:00.637]YABAYABAの感性に
[01:01.963]空空の韻踏み
[01:03.160]
[01:13.256]オーバードライブ加速する
[01:15.723]脈打つ速度は190
[01:18.325]When sight and ecstasy clash,
[01:20.481]in that beast howling, sets my spirit fire
[01:26.085]
[01:51.076]純真無垢？
[01:52.292]馬鹿にしないでよ
[01:53.699]私の何を知ってるの？
[01:55.864]寧ろ大胆不敵
[01:57.400]いつも隠してる
[01:58.691]退屈な速度じゃ感じない
[02:01.016]
[02:01.268]Tire smoke fills the air, engines roar,
[02:03.729]On the edge, craving for far more.
[02:06.292]In this race, we set the pace,
[02:08.805]Feel the heat, embrace the chase.
[02:11.159]
[02:11.277]純真無垢？
[02:12.438]馬鹿にしないでよ
[02:13.885]私の何を知ってるの？
[02:15.959]寧ろ大胆不敵
[02:17.602]いつも隠してる
[02:18.882]退屈な速度じゃ感じない
[02:21.414]
[02:21.575]Give me a reason to beat you down,
[02:23.977]I'll take the crown, won't wear no frown.
[02:26.526]You're in my way, time to face the truth,
[02:28.990]I'll reign supreme, that's my proof.
