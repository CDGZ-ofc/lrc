[00:31.049]Finally we made it through but not without some tears
[00:38.789]With the help of friends so true we faced all of our fears
[00:46.362]Now we're here to celebrate all that we have done
[00:52.581]I can feel it's more than just a game of fate
[00:56.971]'cause our stories have just begun
[00:59.771]
[01:01.556]Hand in hand were not waiting on tomorrow
[01:05.354]From now on its the heart that we will follow
[01:09.206]We'll move on passed the heartbreak and the sorrow If you
[01:12.974]Stay by my side
[01:16.173]
[01:16.965]Dancing harmonies feeding the music as we come alive,
[01:22.098]and sparks ignite
[01:24.638]We're making memories everyday
[01:26.961]underneath the summer sky and through the night
[01:32.261]We're singing melodies every time we hear music
[01:35.865]from inside as hearts collide
[01:40.161]Bringing out the best in each other now
[01:43.200]we're feeling free like were meant to be
[01:47.214]
[01:49.760]Promise I will be there you can call me day or night
[01:57.449]When you need a friend to lean on I'll be there as fast as light
[02:05.125]Nothing's gonna keep us apart not even rain or snow
[02:11.278]'Cause we know that friendships glow and shine so bright
[02:15.392]Melting away what we used to know
[02:18.492]
[02:21.235]No matter how many times we feel we end up chasing our tails,
[02:24.212]in the end things always work out.
[02:26.607]Un, everything happens for a reason,
[02:29.729]and makes us stronger in the end!
[02:31.393]

[02:35.816]Dancing harmonies feeding the music as we come alive,
[02:41.061]and sparks ignite
[02:43.276]We're making memories everyday
[02:45.627]underneath the summer sky and through the night

[02:58.908]Bringing out the best in each other now
[03:01.986]we're feeling free like were meant to be
[03:05.899]
[03:07.179]Even though there's been ruff times where nobody wanted us,
[03:10.831]we kept going, and we kept dreaming, now we are here,
[03:15.027]we're not alone anymore!
[03:16.833]We'll be here together. We have smiles to protect! C'mon, let's go!
[03:21.399]
