[00:27.970]And when it climbs

[00:50.751]This angel I believe in
[00:54.579]Wants me feeling so bad

[01:38.472]Let's analyze
[01:40.597]And agonize
[01:41.588]The last forty things I said
[01:46.162]Get points for style
[01:47.561]And compromise
[01:48.917]With innovative dread
[01:52.081]
[01:53.276]This devil's in my head now
[01:57.342]And he wants me so bad
[02:00.815]Just get this off my shoulders
[02:05.067]Get it all off and fast
[02:08.461]This time I'm giving nothing
[02:12.761]Never giving again
[02:16.917]This devil's in my head now
[02:20.543]Till He jumps out and says
[02:25.006]
[02:25.466](He says) No don't cry
[02:29.391]Oh it's alright
[02:33.337]Your low is rising
[02:37.255]So let the good times ride

[02:45.298]Oh it's all fine
[02:49.001]No agonizing
[02:52.667]Just let the good times rise
[02:56.988]
[02:58.636]No don't fight it
[03:01.203]It's alright
[03:06.523]No compromising
[03:08.977]Black Eyed Susan Climb
[03:12.441]
