[00:17.014]I'm at the store
[00:18.393]I'm looking at the floor
[00:20.523]I calibrate the price tags and regulate the spores
[00:24.890]It's not fair
[00:26.707]But someone's gotta care
[00:28.522]Put things in their place while the world keeps burning
[00:33.256]I'm such a whore
[00:34.549]For automatic doors
[00:36.498]And busted up actors who wash up on the shore
[00:41.063]And lie there for families to stare
[00:44.677]Singing down their scales while the world keeps turning
[00:48.443]
[00:49.142]So play this
[00:53.190]At my funeral
[00:56.937]I already know
[00:59.870]This one's unoriginal
[01:03.440]
[01:05.098]And I feel this
[01:09.243]It's my curtain call
[01:12.839]I already know
[01:15.621]This one's unoriginal
[01:19.936]
[01:21.184]I'm white bread, there's nothing in my head
[01:24.683]There's someone in the tunnels always lurking at the edge
[01:28.895]You stand there, the lights in your hair
[01:32.425]Pure adoration in your stare
[01:36.553]
[01:37.676]In your stare
[01:42.871]You look nice
[01:44.416]You all look nice
[01:46.560]I turn to the crowd and grin like a bear while the world keeps burning
[01:52.172]
[01:53.360]So play this
[01:57.326]At my funeral
[02:01.143]I already know
[02:03.413]This one's unoriginal
[02:07.789]
[02:08.988]And I feel this
[02:13.210]It's my wake up call
[02:16.995]I already know
[02:19.648]This one's unoriginal
[02:32.893]I already know
[02:35.460]This one's unoriginal
[02:39.444]
[02:41.221]It's such a bore
[02:42.701]It's all been done before
[02:44.776]I guess that in a nutshell it's hollow at the core
[02:48.990]It's not fair, but someone's gotta care
[02:52.687]Put things in their place while the world keeps…
