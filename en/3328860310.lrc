[00:15.711]It was August, the future wide as the sky
[00:22.735]A camp for strangers,I walked in shy
[00:29.808]Through lectures I folded paper butterfly,mind astray
[00:37.085]While you were writing galaxies down that I couldn’t convey
[00:44.943]You saw a girl crafting loves out of notebook page
[00:48.523]Quietly burning bright in that academic cage
[00:52.298]You found my friend,then my WeChat, sent a timid request
[00:56.090]You said“hello” next morning, and put my shy heart to rest
[00:59.732]Three nights of truth or dare
[01:01.494]three hours talkin’in dark
[01:03.362]From hometown streets to dreams
[01:04.964]we found the same spark
[01:06.956]Then you were mine in three days—a leap a sweet freefall
[01:10.754]We wrote“forever” before we even knew it all
[01:15.758]And you’re my unexpected perfect
[01:20.141]a plot twist so true
[01:23.846]My teenage dream in a crowded room
[01:27.516]my sky’s sudden blue
[01:30.707]And nothing compares
[01:32.297]no nothing compares to you
[01:34.653]Not the old streets we shared nor the miles we’ve walked through
[01:38.778]You’re the home in my heartbeat
[01:40.758]the love I never knew
[01:42.384]Yeah,nothing in this world compares to you
[01:48.910]You moved to my childhood street
[01:51.244]ten minutes from my door
[01:53.030]We laughed at fate’s strange map
[01:55.218]worth waiting for
[01:56.825]Then came February wind,a fight, a midnight call
[02:00.575]You opened my door
[02:02.008]that’s when I knew I’d give you my all
[02:06.564]But life pulled you away for a brighter stage to shine
[02:09.925]An hour’s drive became the fragile
[02:12.158]trembling line
[02:13.371]I cried alone in halls where your shadow used to stand
[02:17.329]Learning to hold your heart with an open hand
[02:21.265]You promised "no distance"
[02:22.889]then promised you instead
[02:24.998]Through screens and late-night texts through every word unsaid
[02:28.232]We’ve fought with words not weapons—we’ve
[02:30.866]weathered the storm
[02:31.799]Choosing each morning to keep two fragile hearts warm
[02:38.700]‘Cause you’re my unexpected perfect
[02:43.102]a plot twist so true
[02:46.700]My steady ground through every change
[02:50.603]my sky’s constant blue
[02:53.783]And nothing compares
[02:55.188]no nothing compares to you
[02:57.733]Not the memories we’ve made nor the storms
[03:00.271]we’ve pushed through
[03:01.793]You’re the home in my heartbeat
[03:03.729]the love I never knew
[03:05.368]No nothing in this world compares to you
[03:14.741]Happy 18th, my boy…
[03:18.279]You made me believe
[03:21.917]Our universe in blue
