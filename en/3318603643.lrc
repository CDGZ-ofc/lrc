[00:06.098]I’ll be back Sunday
[00:08.793]I’m catching a flight
[00:11.440]But you're out on Monday morning, up before it's light
[00:15.546]Darling, it tears me apart
[00:18.244]You're always so near, but so far away
[00:28.097]
[00:28.118]You’ll be home Tuesday
[00:30.744]But I’m out too late
[00:32.262]As your head touches the pillow
[00:35.488]That’s where I end my day
[00:37.691]Darling, it tears me apart
[00:40.390]Always so near, but so far away
[00:48.888]
[00:48.909]Next time I find you next to me
[00:54.696]There’s no time to waste
[00:58.832]Let’s cut to the chase
[01:01.016]I’m giving you all my loving straight away
[01:12.091]
[01:12.112]We’re both a captain
[01:14.152]Of ships in the night
[01:16.427]But we ain’t got no lighthouse
[01:19.838]Keeping us in sight
[01:21.899]Darling, it tears me apart
[01:24.384]You're always so near, but so far away
[01:33.028]
[01:33.049]Next time I find you next to me
[01:38.878]There’s no time to waste
[01:42.987]Let's cut to the chase
[01:45.281]I’m giving you all my loving straight away
[02:18.350]
[02:18.371]But if there's one night, when the waters are still
[02:22.467]We’d slow down our pace
[02:25.187]We'd meet somewhere in the middle, maybe that'd be a start
[02:30.691]You wouldn't be so quite oh-so far away
[02:39.259]
[02:39.280]Next time I find you next to me
[02:45.189]There’s no time to waste
[02:49.208]Let’s cut to the chase
[02:51.403]I’m giving you all my loving straight away
[03:01.405]Next time I find you next to me
[03:07.573]There’s no time to waste
[03:11.322]Let’s cut to the chase
[03:13.432]I’m giving you all my loving straight away
[03:27.976]Straight away
