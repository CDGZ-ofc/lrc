[00:13.706] To be the pinnacle, there’s a price
[00:16.859] A model of virtue above the vice
[00:20.517] Dressed in gold and flowing white
[00:24.084] The dark is vanquished by your light
[00:29.353] Pretenders that would give their lives
[00:33.053] If painless and was televised
[00:35.599] It’s not easy being nice
[00:38.435] It’s not about the merchandise
[00:43.621] It's so serene, the blue and green, from outer space
[00:49.491] If we all could make it work, it could be such a happy place
[00:58.003] To broker peace so pain can cease
[01:01.360] We are much more than the sum of all our parts
[01:07.175] So go and capture all their hearts
[01:12.568] Cuz you are the teacher
[01:15.479] Shine like a sapphire to guide us
[01:18.910] Wisdom is just in your nature
[01:22.534] Fighting for justice
[01:24.218] You take us higher
[01:28.860] Saw the potential to be good
[01:32.238] So many just misunderstood
[01:35.864] So many lost deep in the wood shall find a way
[01:55.584] Can imagine a world with no fear of hate
[01:58.983] Waking up with no reason for feeling great
[02:02.605] Can imagine the world that you can create
[02:05.995] You’re the fate
[02:06.859] You’re the fate that we deserve
