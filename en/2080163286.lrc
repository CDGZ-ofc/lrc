[00:04.000]And a texture displayed
[00:06.300]I can see it's not a fiction
[00:08.170]From protection, heart has gained
[00:11.320]Even if all emotions shake up, I view that way
[00:16.540]Burgeoning, my story unfolds, uncontained
[00:21.120]Now, tune into the call
[00:22.750]So you can feel which way's where we got to go
[00:25.330]Not just to rise-up high or fall
[00:27.210]A lack of truth while all the rest overflows
[00:30.240]Let's stop lying, and lying, yeah
[00:32.600]Let's get ready, and step ahead
[00:35.180]Blow up!
[00:35.980](Deep down, to be found, shake the self)
[00:38.040](Now or never, yeah)
[00:41.130]We've got to
[00:42.000]Break all chains to reach way beyond
[00:47.120]Break all chains, powers added on
[00:52.110]Wherever you go, voices echo
[00:54.500]Write over that scenario
[00:56.960]Break all chains, never minding what's told
[01:02.320]Now I feel it, now I feel it, yeah, yeah
[01:07.270]Blood exceeded, I can feel it, yeah
[01:12.130]Break all chains to reach way beyond
[01:17.190]And if somebody knows
[01:19.640]Everything's gonna be
[01:21.470]Broken
[01:31.679]
[01:31.700]Stop lying, and lying, yeah
[01:33.980]Let's get ready, and step ahead
[01:36.470]Blow up!
[01:37.320](Deep down, to be found, shake the self)
[01:39.220](Now or never, yeah)
[01:43.110]Distraught and kneeling
[01:45.470]Down in the dark shame
[01:48.030]Resides in mind, old convictions fuel a move
[01:52.880]No longer feeling lost and astray
[01:56.950]Scenes I choose to see and prove
[01:59.890]This passage I proclaim!
[02:02.380]It's time to
[02:03.330]Break all chains to reach way beyond
[02:08.350]Break all chains, powers added on
[02:13.260]Wherever you go, voices echo
[02:15.670]Write over that scenario
[02:18.380]Break all chains, never minding what's told
[02:23.580]Now I feel it, now I feel it, yeah, yeah
[02:28.560]Blood exceeded, I can feel it, yeah
[02:33.250]Break all chains to reach way beyond
