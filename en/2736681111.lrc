[00:15.409]When a little seed buds
[00:17.071]I feel the growing weight of you
[00:22.106]Gave the innocent girl warmth
[00:24.196]from the stone-like body with a heart
[00:28.880]You’ll trace the world
[00:30.091]Not written in the picture book you've read
[00:34.395]Fingers move back and forth
[00:37.249]That’s how we made it here
[00:39.993]
[00:40.363]Out of the cradle that raised you
[00:46.899]Out of the cradle that raised you
[00:53.784]To the stable land below you
[01:00.681]Each time you remember this melody
[01:04.897]Know you’re loved
[01:07.220]
[01:08.335]Go into the glow while I'm in a doze longer than usual
[01:15.010]Time can kill an ancient tree
[01:18.130]Can also grow a little seed
[01:21.679]Dear maiden, take my thought inside
[01:25.162]Feel the breath of all life
[01:28.596]Now the horizon bears the light
[01:31.849]Under the sun, pray for you
[01:35.167]Hope my pulse stays with you
[01:37.794]
[01:52.718]Another day, another pain
[01:56.132]The farther you go
[01:59.456]What you see and who you touch
[02:02.458]Might leave wounds that hurt you over and over again
[02:06.286]But don’t be scared
[02:07.961]Open your hands
[02:09.606]So that love can heal
[02:12.606]Keep feeding the seed
[02:14.062]It could flourish
[02:15.262]I know you know that’s how we live
[02:23.270]
[02:24.109]Out of the cradle that raised you
[02:31.022]To the stable land below you
[02:37.960]I might be too worried
[02:41.306]Without me, know you’re loved
[02:44.558]
[02:45.396]Go into the glow while I'm in a doze longer than usual
[02:52.257]Time can kill an ancient tree
[02:55.450]Can also grow a little seed
[02:58.806]Day after day the gentle light will change you over time
[03:05.753]As spring cloaks herself in green
[03:08.956]You'll wear the warmth around you
[03:11.638]
[03:12.370]One fleeting era's faded here
[03:15.962]Nothing more human than this
[03:19.354]Now the horizon bears the light
[03:22.535]Under the sun, pray for you
[03:26.544]Now the sky bears the light
[03:29.326]Your pulse will stay with mine
