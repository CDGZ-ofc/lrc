[00:14.780]I woke up again with the same regret

[00:38.690]
[00:38.700]I’m reckless yeah I know it’s true
[00:42.250]But it’s the madness that gets me through
[00:46.770]A hopeless anthem just for me
[00:50.140]I find my song yeah yeah yeah!!
[00:53.940]
[00:53.950]They think they know me
[00:55.960]But that’s the old me
