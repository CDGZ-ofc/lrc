[00:12.050]I check myself cuz I should be dead
[00:14.870]The rings of flame still inside my head
[00:17.600]The blue facade slowly turning red
[00:20.310]Evil denizen
[00:23.400]The life support's punctuated hum
[00:26.270]Sit by your side for the day to come
[00:29.110]The truth is black like obsidian
[00:31.660]Seek a medicine
[00:34.970]Get tough
[00:36.380]Don't back out
[00:37.940]Time to ditch your doubt
[00:40.740]Gate crash
[00:41.930]Don't you stop
[00:43.620]Countdown to the drop
[00:46.870]I just couldn't win cuz there was nothing I could ever change
[00:52.370]So puny and thin
[00:54.300]My body was a cage
[00:58.160]But under the skin I got so comfy on this bed of nails
[01:03.100]Death always fails
[01:08.960]Back to take the pain to give you what you're begging for
[01:14.540]Be my shadowborn
[01:20.040]We're back to take the pain
[01:22.880]My soul is indestructible
[01:25.760]I steal you from the grave
[01:28.520]So cursed to be a slave
[01:31.160]There's a darkness I keep that you can never see beyond
[01:36.880]In the dungeons so deep down where the stars ain't ever shone
[01:42.630]There's a distance between us that you'll never overcome
[01:48.340]In the deafening silence when the day has come and gone
[02:06.130]Calm before the storm
[02:08.600]It's me they all are coming for
[02:11.710]Be my shadowborn
[02:17.260]We're back to take the pain
[02:19.980]My soul is indestructible
[02:22.830]I steal you from the grave
[02:25.680]So cursed to be a slave
[02:28.340]There's a darkness I keep that you can never see beyond
[02:34.000]In the dungeons so deep down where the stars ain't ever shone
[02:39.760]There's a distance between us that you'll never overcome
[02:45.430]In the deafening silence when the day has come and gone
