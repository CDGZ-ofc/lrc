[00:13.937]I tried to hide but something broke
[00:17.339]I tried to sing, couldn't hit the notes
[00:19.991]The words kept catching in my throat
[00:24.181]I tried to smile, I was suffocating though
[00:27.001]But here with you, I can finally breathe
[00:30.465]You say you're no good, but you're good for me
[00:34.318]I've been hoping to change, now I know we can change
[00:38.064]But I won't if you're not by my side
[00:42.232]
[00:43.148]Why does it feel right every time I let you in?
[00:46.674]Why does it feel like I can tell you anything?
[00:50.465]All the secrets that keep me in chains, and
[00:53.900]All the damage that might make me dangerous
[00:57.007]You got a dark side, guess you're not the only one
[01:00.242]What if we both tried fighting what we're running from?
[01:04.113]We can't fix it if we never face it
[01:07.531]What if we find a way to escape it?
[01:10.709]
[01:10.845]We could be free, free
[01:18.030]We can't fix it if we never face it
[01:21.293]Let the past be the past 'til it's weightless
[01:24.310]
[01:24.933]Ooh, time goes by, and I lose perspective
[01:28.452]Yeah, hope only hurts, so I just forget it
[01:31.865]But you're breaking through all the dark in me when I thought that nobody could
[01:35.051]And you're waking up all these parts of me that I thought were buried for good
[01:38.431]Between imposter and this monster, I've been lost inside my head
[01:41.912]Ain't no choice when all these voices keep me pointing towards no end
[01:45.342]It's just easy when I'm with you, no one sees me the way you do
[01:48.870]I don't trust it, but I want to, I keep coming back to
[01:51.509]
[01:51.621]Why does it feel right
[01:53.439]every time I let you in?
[01:55.118]Why does it feel like
[01:56.770]I can tell you anything?
[01:58.900]We can't fix it if we never face it
[02:02.369]What if we find a way to escape it?
[02:05.253]
[02:05.374]We could be free, free
[02:12.688]We can't fix it if we never face it
[02:16.083]Let the past be the past 'til it's weightless
[02:18.912]
[02:19.049]Oh, so take my hand, it's open (Free, free)
[02:34.602]What if we heal what's broken? (Free, free)
[02:46.729]
[02:47.619]I tried to hide but something broke
[02:51.093]I couldn't sing, but you give me hope
[02:53.954]We can't fix it if we never face it
[02:57.394]Let the past be the past 'til it's weightless
